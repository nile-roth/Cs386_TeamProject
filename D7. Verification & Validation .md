## 1. Description


The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the worker is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 
The Money Monkey system solves hourly workers’ problem of accurately and fairly calculating paychecks by allowing them to input their hourly wage and then start their shift clock with Money Monkey, which counts along through their shift with both a shift timer and a wage clock that counts the money they’ve made at any given time in their shift. 

## 2. Verification (tests)


### 2.1 Unit test         

A unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable, show an example of a unit test that uses mock objects to isolate the class from the rest of the system. 

**2.1.1** Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.):  Node

**2.1.2** Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located: https://github.com/nilewuzhere/Cs386_TeamProject/blob/D6/testnode.js

**2.1.3** An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.

Class:	https://github.com/nilewuzhere/Cs386_TeamProject/blob/WebsiteUpdates/main.cshtml

Test: https://github.com/nilewuzhere/Cs386_TeamProject/blob/D6/testnode.js

**2.1.4** A print screen showing the result of the unit tests execution.

## 2.2 Acceptance Tests

An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its internal implementation). Provide the following information:

**2.2.1** Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium, Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.): Node

**2.2.2** Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance tests are located.

**2.2.3** An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature.  

**2.2.4** A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution. 

# 3.Validation (user evaluation)

Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. At the beginning of the semester, you talked to the clients/potential users to understand their needs. Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable the following information:

**Script:**

     Questions:
     Q1: How would you compare our UI to your current payroll system?

     Q2: On a scale of 1-10 how user friendly is our webpage (is it easy to navigate and understand)?

     Q3: Is it helpful for you to see the amount of money made alongside the time worked?

     **Results:** Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users. Report the data that you collected.

User1: Dimitrius
A1: Great interface, would be good for my current job when hours run over schedule. 
A2: 7.5
A3: Yeah.

User2: Aiden 
A1: Easier to absorb than current payroll app
A2: 8
A3: Yes

User3: Matthew 
A1: Great, cool if graphics were a little bigger so it is easier to find
A2: 9
A3: Yes

**Reflections:**

The 3 users were able to complete the tasks given without issue. They all seemed to enjoy the website's usability and found it to be more pleasing to use than their regular payroll system. One piece of feedback we received was that we should make the start shift button larger and more accessible. We believe that from these results we accomplished our value propositions.
