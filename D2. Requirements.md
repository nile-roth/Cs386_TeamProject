# CS 386 – Software Engineering
## **Team Project – D.2 Requirements**

## **Problem statement**
“The problem of inefficient prioritization of homework assignments affects college students; the impact of which is delivering 
assignments past due and receiving low grades.” The problem should read as a problem (must be something bad that makes people spend time or money in an inefficient 
way.

The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours.

## **Product Position Statement**
“For college students who have many parallel homework assignments, MyPrioritizationApp is a planning app that crowdsources 
the identification of complexity and time necessary to accomplish assignments, supporting the informed prioritization; unlike myHomework Student Planner, our product 
does not rely on the judgment of a student who hasn’t started the homework yet.” Make sure your product position statement is related to your problem.


## **Product Position**: 
For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a
payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the user is always being paid the correct
amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which make the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. 


## **Value proposition**: Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, 
to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 
Consumer segment: College student who works on campus and needs to track their wages for a timesheet. 


## **Stakeholders**
Make a list of all stakeholders of the project with a brief description of each one of them, emphasizing any responsibilities with the project. 
Examples of stakeholders include users, clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc.

College students/highschool students working part time jobs
Employees who work without a clock-in clock-out system
Employers who could cut the wage of employees short 

## **Functional requirements (features)**
1. The interface shall prompt the user for their hourly wage upon application startup.
          	1.1 The hourly wage shall be enterable in the form of U.S. dollars.
          	1.2 The hourly wage shall have a minimum value of $0.00 and a maximum value of $999.00.
2. The display shall show a simple timer.
          	2.1 The timer shall display hours, seconds, and minutes.
          	2.2 The timer shall be initialized to 00:00:00.
          	2.3 The maximum values for the sections of the timer shall be as follows: 99 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds.
          	2.4 The timer shall count up from the initial time once the user starts the clock.
          	2.5 The timer shall stop counting once the user stops the clock.
          	2.6 The last time reached before the clock was stopped shall remain visible on the screen until the timer is started or reset.
3. The interface shall provide users a way to start, pause, stop, or reset the timer.
          	3.1 The users shall be able to interact with the timer through labeled buttons on the display.
          	3.2 The start button shall begin the timer count from its most recent value.
          	3.3 The pause button shall temporarily stop the timer at its current value until the user starts the timer again.
          	3.4 The stop button shall permanently stop the timer at its current value.
          	3.5 The reset button shall return the timer to its initial value.
4. The application shall calculate the user’s earnings per second.
          	4.1 The user’s earnings per second shall be calculated as the user’s earnings per hour divided by 60.
5. The display shall show the user a total for their earnings.
          	5.1 The earnings display shall increment with every second that passes on the clock.
6. The application shall be accessible as a website and as a mobile app.



## **Non-functional requirements**
Portability is really important so that the customers can log their hours from whatever they have access to at the beginning and end of their shifts. The goal should 
be to access the website from a mobile device and a PC. 
The software also needs good usability so that young users tracking hours for the first time are able to use it without challenges. This could be measured by having 
users test the software and rate the usability on a scale of 1 to 10.

## **MVP**
Our MVP will be a standard timer that has the ability to start, stop, and reset (refreshing the webpage). A wage count will then be implemented by using a database and a timer to calculate the wage. The features that will be validated are the timer and the wage count that increases as the timer increases. We will test this via mobile and web applications to ensure the usability of the product. 

## **Use cases**
Use case diagram
Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use, such as https://app.diagrams.net/ and https://creately.com/

## **1. Starts the shift clock**

![use case description 1](https://i.ibb.co/DKNSgwX/1.jpg)

Actor: Worker 

Preconditions: worker inputs wage

Basic Flow:
The use case begins when worker opens the application.
The worker inputs their hourly wage 
The worker selects ‘start shift’ and timer starts

Alternate Flows:
If a worker doesn’t input a valid wage, an error message will be displayed
The worker must return to step iii of basic flow

Subflows:
NA

Key Scenarios:
Worker is starting a shift

Post-Conditions:
A clock begins to run by dollars/second
Special Requirements
NA

## **2. Views shift earnings**

![use case description 3](https://i.ibb.co/QPRh6Lm/3.jpg)

Actor: Worker

Preconditions:
worker inputs wage
worker starts the shift clock

Basic Flow:
The use case begins when the worker starts the time clock
The worker goes to the home page
The system displays the wage clock that updates as the shift clock increases.

Alternate Flow:
If in step ii of the Basic Flow, the worker stops the shift clock: 
A celebration for completing a shift will be displayed
The total wages earned for the shift will be displayed

Subflows:
N/A

Key Scenarios:
worker started a shift. 

Post-Conditions:
The wages earned in a shift will be stored in the database

Special Requirements:
Should be able to see earnings when worker is still clocked in and when they are clocked out. 

## **3. Pauses shift clock**

![use case description 2](https://i.ibb.co/ZdKP0Br/2.jpg)

Actor:Worker

Preconditions:
worker inputs wage
worker starts a shift clock

Basic Flow of Events:
The use case begins when the worker opens the application
The worker enters their wage
The worker begins their shift
The worker pauses the clock by selecting the corresponding button.

Alternative Flows: 
If in step 1, the worker does not input their wage, then
An error message will appear and the worker cannot progress
After they input their wage, the use case resumes at  step iii
If in step iv, the worker does not pause the clock
Timer will progress

Subflow:
NA

Key Scenarios:
Open the application

Post-conditions:
The timer and wage clock will stop until the worker resumes the clock

Special Requirements:

## **4. Confirm Paycheck**

![use case description 6](https://i.ibb.co/kmJD4Fb/5.jpg)

Actor: Worker

Preconditions:
Starting the shift clock, inputting wage, ending shift clock, 

pausing shift clock, and completing a full shift are all preconditions.

Basic flow of Events:

The clock will resume running
The use case resumes at step 1

Subflows: Step 4
The application prompts the worker to confirm they would like to end their shift
