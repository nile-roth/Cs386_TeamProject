# **Team Project – D.6 Implementation 2**

## **1. Introduction**
  The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the worker is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 
The Money Monkey system solves hourly workers’ problem of accurately and fairly calculating paychecks by allowing them to input their hourly wage and then start their shift clock with Money Monkey, which counts along through their shift with both a shift timer and a wage clock that counts the money they’ve made at any given time in their shift.

## **1. Implemented requirements**

The interface shall prompt the user for their hourly wage upon application startup.

          	1.1 The hourly wage shall be enterable in the form of U.S. dollars.
            
          	1.2 The hourly wage shall have a minimum value of $0.00 and a maximum value of $999.00.
            
The display shall show a simple timer.

          	2.1 The timer shall display hours, seconds, and minutes.
            
          	2.2 The timer shall be initialized to 00:00:00.
            
          	2.3 The maximum values for the sections of the timer shall be as follows: 99 hours, 59 minutes, 59 seconds.
            
          	2.4 The timer shall count up from the initial time once the user starts the clock.
            
          	2.5 The timer shall stop counting once the user stops the clock.
            
          	2.6 The last time reached before the clock was stopped shall remain 
                visible on the screen until the timer is started or reset.
            
The interface shall provide users a way to start, pause, stop, or reset the timer.

          	3.1 The users shall be able to interact with the timer through labeled buttons on the display.
            
          	3.2 The start button shall begin the timer count from its most recent value.
            
          	3.3 The pause button shall temporarily stop the timer at 
            its current value until the user starts the timer again.
            
          	3.4 The stop button shall permanently stop the timer at its current value.
            
          	3.5 The reset button shall return the timer to its initial value.
            
The application shall calculate the user’s earnings per second.
