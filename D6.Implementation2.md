# **Team Project – D.6 Implementation 2**

## **1. Introduction**
  The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the worker is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 
The Money Monkey system solves hourly workers’ problem of accurately and fairly calculating paychecks by allowing them to input their hourly wage and then start their shift clock with Money Monkey, which counts along through their shift with both a shift timer and a wage clock that counts the money they’ve made at any given time in their shift.

## **5. Code Quality**

We managed code quality by using code comments and keeping similar code conventions. For example, we kept our coding styles consistent across languages and developers by using indentation and spacing throughout the code. Our variable names were self-documenting, but we still described what our functions did. We organized our files on GitHub by deliverables and put our commonly used code within the main branch, merging when needed.

## **6. Lessons Learned**

Our team learned that we need to prioritize back-end work as much as front end. We have been focusing on front-end development for the majority of the project but have had trouble figuring out how to implement the database for our website. If we were to continue developing Money Monkey, we would probably focus on back-end development to save user information.
