## **1. Description**
The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the worker is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 

The Money Monkey system will solve hourly workers’ problem of accurately and fairly calculating paychecks by allowing them to input their hourly wage and then start their shift clock with Money Monkey, which will count along through their shift with both a shift timer and a wage clock that counts the money they’ve made at any given time in their shift. Workers with accounts can save these shifts to have their entire paychecks accurately counted, or they can simply track their current shift without making an account.
