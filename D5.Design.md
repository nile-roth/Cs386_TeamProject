## **1. Description**
The problem of finding time to accurately track all work hours affects hourly workers; the impact of which is the potential of shorted paychecks or unpaid hours. For young adults and college students who have trouble keeping track of their gross hourly income and overtime, Money Monkey is a payroll tracking app that keeps track of any potential errors that might occur on a paycheck and ensures that the worker is always being paid the correct amount; unlike ADP, Money Monkey has an aesthetic UI, which makes the user feel trendy while keeping track of their income. Money Monkey allows hourly wage workers to track the amount of money they have made on their shift, to ensure that the worker is being paid the correct amount and to mitigate any potential error with their paycheck. 

The Money Monkey system will solve hourly workers’ problem of accurately and fairly calculating paychecks by allowing them to input their hourly wage and then start their shift clock with Money Monkey, which will count along through their shift with both a shift timer and a wage clock that counts the money they’ve made at any given time in their shift. Workers with accounts can save these shifts to have their entire paychecks accurately counted, or they can simply track their current shift without making an account.

**Use Case Description:**

**Use case:** Receive error message

**Actor:** Worker

**Description:** The worker receives a message that their expected paycheck and actual paycheck did not match.
Preconditions: Worker has completed the shifts for their pay period and has entered the paycheck they received into Money Monkey.
Postconditions: The worker resolves the pay error in the Money Monkey system to clear the notification.
Main flow:

**1.** The worker views the comparison shown in the error message.

**2.** The worker verifies that they have viewed the error message and are aware of the difference in pay.

**3.** (a) The worker clears the error, notifying the system that they have gotten their paycheck corrected

**4.** The Money Monkey system updates their payroll history with the amount the worker was paid.

**Alternative Flows:**

**3. (b)** The worker selects the option to ignore the error.

**1.** The system clears the notification.

***a)** The worker realizes they have made a mistake entering their paycheck and chooses to override the error.
          	**1.** The system prompts the worker to enter a new paycheck amount
          **2.** The Money Monkey system updates their payroll history with the amount the worker was paid.

## **5. Design Patterns**

## **6. Design Principles**
Single-responsibility Principle: Every class should only have one responsibility

EX: We have separate classes for payroll tracking, storage, and verification. The payroll tracking class takes in payroll data such as wages and hours, the payroll history class will store it, and this data can be used by the payroll comparison class to produce errors to bring to the user’s attention.

Open-closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

EX: Extending the behavior of the Money Monkey shift clock is possible, but this will not change its purpose. For example, the shift clock could be modified to work with a different country’s currency and this would not change its connection to the shift timer or alter its behavior of counting along with it.
