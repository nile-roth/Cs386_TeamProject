# CS 386 – Software Engineering
## Team Project – D.4 Implemenation

## **1. Introduction**
Our project’s current state provides a user with a stopwatch as well as a wage count. This 
allows workers to track the length of their shift, and observe how much they have made. With 
this web app, users will save time achieving these values without having to do annoying 
calculations. 

## **2. Implemented requirements**
1).
   Requirement: The interface shall prompt the user for their hourly wage upon application startup.

## **4. Adopted technologies**

Github - To collaborate on the project simultaneously without conflict and for version control.  
We chose to use GitHub because it is popular for version control and because we already had some  
experience with it.  
  
Azure - To implement a database system and store user information for our product. We chose  
Azure because we were able to set up student accounts and because it gave us the ability to do what  
we needed in a simple manner.  
  
Visual Studio - To connect to the database and publish to our website. We used Visual Studio  
because it works well with Azure and because we have some prior experience in it.  
  
  
## **5.Learning/training**  
  
To learn/refresh our knowledge on Github, each member took a short course on the basics of  
Github. We learned how we can push and pull files with Git and how it helps the team work more  
efficiently together.  
  
For Azure, some of our members found helpful instructional videos that related to the development of  
our project. They taught us how to manage our database for our website, as well as managing tables.  
  
For Visual Studio, one of our members made an instructional video that taught us how to connect to  
the database, and how we can manage it through Visual Studio.  
  
  
## **6. Deployment**  
  
  
## **7. Licensing**  
  
Our team decided to adopt the GNU General Public License v3.0 to give others the freedom to modify  
and use our product as necessary. However, we want any modified version of our project to also be  
copyleft and allow these same permissions.  
  
  
## **8. Readme File**  
  
  
## **9. Look & feel**  
  
For our user interface, we decided to go with a very simple layout for aesthetics and usability  
purposes. We want the user to feel trendy, sophisticated, but with a sense of childlike wonder. One  
of our main goals is to compete with ADP’s UI, which is geared towards a corporate feel. Our  
whimsical interface is also easier to navigate. Our mascot also gives a “playfully quaint” feel.   
The shift clock is our main feature, so we wanted to make it stand out when we add other objects  
to our website.

## **10. Lessons learned**  
  
In the first release, we learned how to get most of the basic features of our MVP implemented into  
our website. We were able to get a working wage timer, a wage input button, a username input, and  
some simple css stylization for the page. For the second release, we plan to implement some side  
features to be accessible to the user on the website, as well as give the mascot some animations  
to play on the page.
