# CS 386 – Software Engineering
## Team Project – D.4 Implemenation

## **1. Introduction**
Our project’s current state provides a user with a stopwatch as well as a wage count. This 
allows workers to track the length of their shift, and observe how much they have made. With 
this web app, users will save time achieving these values without having to do annoying 
calculations.
